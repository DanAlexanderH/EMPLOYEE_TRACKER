By using the arrow keys and hitting enter on your keyboard, you can go through each option and be able to view all current employees, roles, and departments in the database. You can also choose to add new employees, roles, and departments if you want. One last feature that was added was the ability to update an employee's role when entering the Update Employee Role option.
